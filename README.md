Task: Real Estate App!
An agent from USTA (the “Urban Space... something…) real estate brokers have asked for a software to organize their properties. 
They have provided a data file for us to read in and display the properties they have listed for sale. Let us design a basic mobile app around what they want to see. 


To run this program, first ensure git is properly downloaded on your device. 
If git is not already properly installed, refer to the pdf below for instructions on how to download it.

Once git is properly installed, navigate to our github page.
Click the green-colored Code button and copy the hyperlink from the SSH option as shown in the image.
